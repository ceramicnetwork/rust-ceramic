# Installation

Installation of rust-ceramic is covered here, but a functioning js-ceramic node requires a running js-ceramic daemon to be available.

See [developers.ceramic.network](https://developers.ceramic.network/docs/composedb/set-up-your-environment#2c-installation-using-javascript-package-managers) for instructions on how to install js-ceramic.
