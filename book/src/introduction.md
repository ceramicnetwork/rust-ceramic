# Introduction

`rust-ceramic` is a Rust library for working with the [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network) and is under active development.

The current implementation requires a running [js-ceramic](https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-ceramic) daemon to be available.

## Features

Replace IPFS as the data storage layer for js-ceramic with a Rust-based implementation.

## Limitations

rust-ceramic is currently in an alpha state and is not yet suitable for production use. The API is subject to change and there are known limitations and bugs.
