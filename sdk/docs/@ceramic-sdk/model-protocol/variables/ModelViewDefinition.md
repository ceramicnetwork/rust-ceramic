Identifies types of properties that are supported as view properties at DApps' runtime

A view-property is one that is not stored in related MIDs' content, but is derived from their other properties

Currently supported types of view properties:
- 'documentAccount': view properties of this type have the MID's controller DID as values
- 'documentVersion': view properties of this type have the MID's commit ID as values
- 'relationDocument': view properties of this type represent document relations identified by the given 'property' field
- 'relationFrom': view properties of this type represent inverse relations identified by the given 'model' and 'property' fields
- 'relationCountFrom': view properties of this type represent the number of inverse relations identified by the given 'model' and 'property' fields
