# iroh-rpc-types

This crate defines the protocol for use by the
[iroh-rpc-client](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/tree/main/iroh-rpc-client),
which is used for [iroh](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh) services to
communicate internally via RPC.

It defines a set of messages and traits that specify how each message is to be
processed.

These types can be used with any transport protocol in
[quic-rpc](https://github.com/n0-computer/quic-rpc).
