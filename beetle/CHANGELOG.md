# [v0.2.0](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/compare/v0.1.1...v0.2.0) (2022-12-21)

### First steps for iroh as a library
Many folks have asked for iroh as a library embeddable in other rust projects, and with this release we land the the first version of `iroh-embed`. Check the [example](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/blob/e73a731769269c58b5d32e4a207e6577b3c50838/examples/embed/src/main.rs) for an initial guide.

We still have a _lot_ of work to do on `iroh-api` to expose a clean API to consume as a library, but if you're the kind of project that's intersted in embedded IPFS, and willing to roll up your sleeves on a moving API, Iroh is ready for you to use today.


### Gateway Subdomain & ETH domain support
Our gateway [spec compatibility](https://github.com/ipfs/specs/tree/main/http-gateways) continues to grow. Both of these features were outside contributions by [@ppodolsky](https://github.com/ppodolsky), for which we're super grateful. Be sure to check out their work on [summa](https://github.com/izihawa/summa)!

### QUIC Support
The majority of traffic on public IPFS networks runs over QUIC, which we now support within iroh thanks to a [massive push by the rust-libp2p team](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p/pull/2289). Huge thanks to the libp2p team!

This relase brings about a couple of highlights, the first of which is the first relase of all `iroh-*` crates to crates.io. The second one being that we now support the experimental quic transport in libp2p.

# [v0.1.1](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/compare/v0.1.0...v0.1.1) (2022-11-21)

## Bitswap client mode
Iroh can now run in "client mode", which can _fetch_ content from bitswap, but not _provide_ content. This is useful if you're running on a lower-powered device or have limited bandwidth. To use client mode change your `p2p.config.toml`:
```
bitswap_server = false
```

## Use indexer nodes to find content providers
Iroh can use network indexers like [cid.contact](https://cid.contact) to find providers of a given CID. To use the cid.contact indexer adjust your `gateway.config.toml` to add an `indexer_endpoint` URL:

```
indexer_endpoint = https://cid.contact/cid/
```

## Docker support
Iroh now ships with docker images! Spin iroh up locally with:
```
$ cd iroh/docker
$ docker-compose up
```
then run `iroh status` from another terminal if you already have iroh installed. Now you're backing iroh with docker! `docker-compose down` to stop. The docker compose file also includes helpful guidance on which ports to expose from each iroh service.

We're shipping multi-arch [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) builds for amd64 & arm64 architectures.

## Fixed a critical bug adding files
We fixed a [known bug](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/issues/423) in iroh v0.1.0 that would break `iroh add` if files referenced the same CID on the way in. It's now fixed, and now we can happily do roundtrip add/get of the linux kernel, which is always fun ðŸ˜Š.


## Benchmarks
Benchmarks for this release coming soon. We'll update this readme once they're up.

### Production Readiness
Is this production ready? **Maybe**. Numerous projects are now using iroh in the wild. *You'll need to judge for yourself if iroh meets your needs.* Please reach out on our [discussion forums](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/discussions) if you have questions. We're going to keep the status at "Maybe" until we release a v1.0. v1.0 is currently slated for Q4 2023.

# v0.1.0 - 2022-10-28

Weâ€™re on the board ðŸŽ‰! This first release of iroh brings a new implementation of IPFS to the world. 

Key things to highlight about the first release of iroh:

* **Exchange Data with Kubo**. Iroh can interoperate with [kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) nodes on the IPFS network, pushing & fetching data.
* **Service Oriented architecture**. Don't want p2p? Turn it off! Iroh will still work without it.
* **Single CLI to control all services**. 
* **Built for efficiency**. Iroh's memory footprint & CPU usage are either on par or better than the best interoperable IPFS implementations out there.
* **Runs well on a laptop**. We have a custom installer script that will configure iroh for your laptop. See our [install docs](https://iroh.computer/docs/install)

v0.1.0 ships as 4 binaries for Linux & macOS with zero external dependencies:
* **iroh** - command line client
* **iroh-store** - data storage daemon
* **iroh-p2p** - peer 2 peer networking
* **iroh-gateway** - IPFS-to-HTTP bridge

You'll need to download all of them & put them on your $PATH to work with iroh. Our [install docs](https://iroh.computer/docs/install) have more info.

Please do give iroh a try, we'd love to [hear your feedback](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/issues/new). Thanks!

### Benchmarks
We're runnning benchmarks on a relatively stock AWS box for ease-of-replication. We don't have benchmarks for IPFS network retrieval this round.

### Adding Single Files
Add a single file with `iroh add --no-wrap --offline`:

| file size  | real (s) |	user(s) |	sys(s)   |	cpu %      |	cpu/total % |
| ---------- | -------- | ------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------ |   
| 100K       |	0.0102	| 0.0162  | 0.0317   | 469.6078431 | 7.337622549  |
| 1M  	     |  0.0167	| 0.004	  | 0.0519   | 334.7305389 | 5.230164671  |
| 10M        |	0.01345	| 0.0101  | 0.0418	 | 385.87	     | 6.03         |
| 100M       |	0.01345	| 0.0101  |	0.0418	 | 385.87	     | 6.03         |
| 1G         |	0.01345	| 0.0101  |	0.0418   | 385.87    	 | 6.03         |

### Fetching Cached Gateway Content
Repeatedly request the same CID of different file sizes to measure cached content throughput via HTTP request

| File size   | cpu/total (%)  | rps       | throughput/s  | avg latency  |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| 100K        | 90.48072917    | 40,064.27 | 3.85GB        | 5.08ms       |
| 1M          | 87.66614583    | 6,926.95  | 6.77GB        | 29.08ms      |
| 10M         | 87.34010417    | 711.55    | 6.98GB        | 278.86ms     |
| 100M        | 88.00885417    | 66.52     | 6.82GB        | 2.85s        |
| 1G          | 87.84947917    | 6.65      | 6.85GB        | 0.00s        |

### Production Readiness
Is this production ready? **No. We need your help to kick tires & find bugs!**.

The v0.1.0 moniker should testify to just how new this software is. Please don't deploy it anywhere mission critical until we've had at least a month or two to address bugs & write tests.

### Things you should know about this release:
There are two problems we couldn't properly address
* _There is no delete command._ Data added to iroh will stay there until a future release where we add content removal.  See [issue #432](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/issues/432) for details. The workaround for now is to blow away the storage database.
* _We have one particularly nasty known bug that can cause iroh to not persist data for highly nested directories upon add_ we plan to address ASAP in a patch release. See [issue #423](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/issues/423).

### Bug Fixes

* `check` and `watch` should display the same service names ([#101](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/issues/101)) ([ef99fe5](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/commit/ef99fe5c6d519eca6f8ad972323526345dd155fb))
